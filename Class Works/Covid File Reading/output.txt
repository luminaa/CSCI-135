Please note that the numbers are in a log scale)• Research was done on surgical masks, not for N95 masks, but the two types of masks are made of comparable materials, i.e. non-woven polypropylene.This implies that a used mask can be placed in a paper bag (please don't use plastic bags, they trap humidity and let the virus survive for longer. See CDC recommendations.) and wait before re-using. This new research by the Lancet suggest that 7 days should be the very minimum of time to wait.The CDC guidelines for sanitizing and reusing masks: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/decontamination-reuse-respirators.htmlOther study results: Inactivation on different surfaces:-printing paper and tissue paper - 3 hours until virus became inactivated-cloth and wood - no virus on day 2-smooth surface (glass and bank notes) - no virus on day 4-stainless steel and plastic - day 7(A different study put survival on cardboard at 1 day. The different types of fabrics are not studied, but smooth surfaces like waterproof jackets would probably behave more like plastic.)pH , temperature and cleaning solutions:-COVID-19 is stable between pH of 3-10 (Vinegar would NOT kill it)-Virus is undetectable 70C (158F) after 5 minutes. Suggest N95 can be baked (but baking might change the shape, making the seal less effective.) Also undetectable at room temperature 22C (72F) after 14 days, evidence of prolonged stability in the fridge (4C) for weeks.Effectively killed by 1:49 and 1:99 bleach, ethanol 70%, 7.5% iodine, 0.05% chloroxylenol and chlorhexidine, 0.1% benzalkonium chloride (the stuff that's in some non-alcoholic hand sanitizers). Handsoap solution left passively on a surface also works after a 5 min wait.The research implies that a fabric mask may actually be quicker to self-disinfect than a surgical mask (<2 days vs >7 days) in the absence of other washing/disinfecting practices.

False negative before when the virus hasn’t fully cleared out of their system yet.

That could mean no vaccine may ever work.How long do you think it will be before scientists know substantial proven FACTS about this? Because the lack of knowing is driving me to madness.
